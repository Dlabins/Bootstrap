# Bootstrap
The purpose of this website is to showcase information and skills about myself for future employers to review. Using semantic HTML accompanied by CSS, the developer has achieved a functional and responsive website. Included in each webpage is a consistent navbar with links to all other pages (About Me, Portfolio, and Contact Me). The HMTL of these webpages has been validated via an online validator at https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html. The HTML present in each of the three pages is a mix between original code and Bootstrap components to effectively display information as organized as possible. Lastly, the responsiveness of the HTML content as well as images have been optimized for all media screen types. The following link will direct a user to the home page: https://dlabins.github.io/Bootstrap-HW-2/.
